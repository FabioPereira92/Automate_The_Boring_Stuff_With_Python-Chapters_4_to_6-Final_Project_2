# Adventure Quest - A small text-based adventure game
An adventure game where you explore the Dark Woods, fight Goblins, Wolves and Bandits and find Treasures!

Win by surviving until you find 3 treasures.

The final score is how much gold you have at the end.

## Features
Start by choosing your character's name and then, from the main menu you can choose to:
- Explore, where you risk fighting Goblins, Wolves and Bandits at locations such as a
Castle, a Witch House, a Tavern or a Bandit's Lair, to find treasures.
- Rest, where you replenish your health points full.
- Check inventory to see what items you have.
- Shop, where you can buy new items as long as you have enough gold.
- Show scores, where you can see all the previous scores since the program was open.
- Exit game to terminate the program.

When you find a treasure, no more treasures can be found at that location. When you find
enemies, you lose the game if they kill you and if you kill them, they no longer can be
found at that location. While fighting you can take a potion to fully replenish your health
if you have one. When you find 3 treasures you win the game.
